# CTU Extended

The CTU Extended app aims to improve the user experience of the CTU student portal by adding new features and fixing existing issues. The app is designed to run as a Tampermonkey userscript, which means it can be installed and run on any modern web browser.

## Features

The CTU Extended app includes the following features:

- **Deeper Grade Insights**: View detailed grade information for each subject, including the current absolute grade and percentage, as well as the number of points needed to achieve an A.

## Installation

This script is designed to run through Tampermonkey, a popular userscript manager. You can install it directly from the repository, or from Greasyfork.

### Tampermonkey installation

1. Install Tampermonkey from the [official website](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) if you haven't already.
2. Copy the JavaScript code from this repository.
3. Open Tampermonkey in your browser and click on the "Create a new script...".
4. Paste the copied JavaScript code into the script area.
5. Save the script.

### Greasyfork installation

1. Navigate to the script's page on [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/490426-ctu-grade-calculator).
2. Click on the "Install this script" button.
3. Tampermonkey should automatically detect the script and prompt you to install it.

Now, whenever you open the CTU student portal in your browser, the CTU Extended app will automatically run and add new features to the website.
